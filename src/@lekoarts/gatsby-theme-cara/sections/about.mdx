## About

> 

I'm a full stack engineer with a front end focus. Before coming to tech, I spent 10+ years leading on-site engineering projects in the oil and gas industry and multiple seasons on emergency response ski patrol. As an adaptable problem solver, I excel in fast changing, high stakes environments. Currently, Iâ€™m pursuing roles with mission driven teams where I can grow and make an impact.
